# Spider Chef üï∑Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüç≥

SpiderChef is a powerful, recipe-based web scraping tool that makes data extraction systematic and reproducible. By defining scraping procedures as "recipes" with sequential "steps," SpiderChef allows you to craft elegant, maintainable data extraction workflows.

```
                   /\
                  /  \
                 |  _ \                   _
                 | / \ \   .--,--        / \

```

## Features

- **Recipe-Based Architecture**: Define extraction workflows as YAML recipes
- **Modular Step System**: Build complex scraping logic from reusable components
- **Async Support**: Handle both synchronous and asynchronous extraction steps
- **Type Safety**: Fully typed for better development experience
- **Extensible Design**: Easily create custom steps for specialized extraction needs

## Installation

```bash
# If you want to use the cli
pip install spiderchef[cli]

# If you just want the library usage
pip install spiderchef
```

## Why SpiderChef?

Traditional web scraping often involves writing complex, difficult-to-maintain code that mixes HTTP requests, parsing, and business logic. SpiderChef separates these concerns by:

- Breaking extraction into discrete, reusable steps
- Defining workflows as declarative recipes
- Handling common extraction patterns with built-in steps
- Making scraping procedures reproducible and maintainable

Whether you're scraping product data, monitoring prices, or extracting research information, SpiderChef helps you build structured, reliable data extraction pipelines.
